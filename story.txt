this the begining of the story: Once upon a time, a timid dragon was protected by a strong knight in a castle, but the dragon desired to see the world outside. --written by Zhiwei Cao
This the second line of the story.  The knight told his dragon that when you become strong enough, I'll just let you go without hesitation -- written by Tianwei Bao
This is the end of the story: 30 years later, the dragon finally became a mighty creature. However, the knight was too old and close to death. He told the dragon to leave and to explore the outside world, and he made a request: protect the kingdom he came from. -- written by Minghao Zhou
